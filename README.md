# BCI_Visualization
Designed an SSVEP (Steady State Visual Evoked Potential) Program to stimulate particularbrain frequencies
for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research. 

This code is the first part of the BCI process. By looking at the boxes, flashing at a user inputted frequency, 
this code stimulates the brain at that frequency.
